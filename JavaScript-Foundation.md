# Javascript Engine

There's a ton of JS engines !

V8 engine was created by google, the other engines were too slow!

V8 was created in 2008.

What is inside the engine?

Who created the first JS engine? Brenden Eich.

He created JavaScript and the spider monkey engine!

# JavaScript Engine 

Inside the engine !

# interpreter

translates and read the files line by line

# compiler

it works ahead of time to create a translations for our machine in another language (machine code)

# Babel

Babel is a JS compiler that takes in moder JS code and returns browser compatible JS

# Typescript

Typescript is a superset of JS that compiles down to JS.

Both of these do excatly what compilers do: Take one language and convert into a different one!

# Is JS an interperted language? It depends on the implementaion
